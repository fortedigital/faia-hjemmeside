# Commit and Create PR

## Steps
w
1. **Review changes** - `git status` and `git diff` to understand what was implemented
2. **Check for sensitive files** - Before proceeding, check for files that might pass through gitignore but should not be committed:
   - Run `git status --porcelain` to get all changed files (staged and unstaged)
   - Check for sensitive file patterns:
     - `.env*` files (`.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.production`, etc.)
     - Files with sensitive keywords in name: `*secret*`, `*key*`, `*password*`, `*token*`, `*credential*`, `*api-key*`
     - Database files: `*.db`, `*.sqlite`, `*.sqlite3`
     - Private key files: `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.p12`, `*.pfx`
     - `appsettings.json` or `appsettings.Production.json` (unless explicitly approved)
     - `DataProtection-Keys/` directory (contains encryption keys)
   - If any sensitive files are detected:
     - **DO NOT create the PR**
     - Report the detected files to the user with a clear error message
     - Suggest adding them to `.gitignore` if they're not already there
     - Exit the workflow
3. **Update changelogs** - Add brief entries under today's date (`## [YYYY-MM-DD]`) in appropriate sections:
   - **CHANGELOG.md** – Technical, one line per change (Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed). Keep it concise.
   - **CHANGELOG_BRUKER.md** – User-facing: same date and section type (Nytt/Endret/Rettet/Fjernet). Write in plain Norwegian so end users understand what changed; focus on what they see or can do, not implementation details.
4. **Create branch** - `feat/`, `fix/`, or `refactor/` prefix (e.g., `feat/add-timebank`)
5. **Commit** - Use conventional commit format (see below)
   - **CRITICAL: Never use `--no-verify`** - hooks must run
   - **CRITICAL: Use `required_permissions: ['all']`** - pre-commit hook needs full filesystem access
6. **Push and create PR** - Use `required_permissions: ['all']` for network access. Keep PR description brief and focused on what was implemented.

## Commit Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
